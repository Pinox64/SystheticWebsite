    <h1>Meet the PolyCluster</h1>
    <p>
      This is a physical performance dashboard for your PC: a compact 4-gauge cluster with     real needle dials and tiny screens that you can label however you want. Each gauge     runs from 0 to 100, so you can map it to anything – CPU, GPU, RAM, temperature, fan    speed, network usage, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powered by USB and talking to your computer over standard HID, it’s plug-and-play and      always in view, no alt-tabbing required. RGB backlighting lets it blend into your      setup or stand out on your desk, giving you a clean, at-a-glance view of how your      machine is really behaving while you game, create, or code.
